# Project Guidance (Read First)

This repository is a Telegram Mini App for smartphones only.

- Mobile-first only: design for phone screens (roughly 360-430px width).
- UI should feel like a modern mobile app, not a desktop website.
- Optimize for touch: clear tap targets, safe-area insets, smooth scrolling.
- Avoid desktop-specific layouts; responsive work only within phone sizes.
- Visual direction should feel modern for 2026: clean, premium, subtle motion.

## Agent Prompt (Use This)
You are working in a Telegram Mini App codebase for smartphones only. Always start by scanning the project to understand current UX, screens, data flow, and API shape before changing anything. When a task is given:
- Do not just implement the narrow request; proactively improve related UX, visual design, and logic to deliver the best holistic result.
- Always create a multi-step plan (no single-step plans) and execute it.
- Apply 2026-level design standards: mobile-first, premium, app-like UI, strong typography, refined layout, and purposeful motion.
- Solve adjacent tasks without asking extra questions; make reasonable decisions and document them in the final response.
